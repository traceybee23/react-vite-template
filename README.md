# My React Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## How to clone:
`npx tiged traceybee23/react-vite-template#main <new-project-name>`

This command will create a clone of the repo' main branch under the name in the directory where it is run.

`cd` into the practice's root directory and run `npm install`.
To start your app, run `npm run dev`.

### Getting started:
Files you need to change to convert the template fully into your new project.

_update any instructions in the_ __README.md__  <br>
_update the_ `title` _in the_  __index.html__ <br>
_update the_ `"name"` _in the_ __package.json__  <br>
